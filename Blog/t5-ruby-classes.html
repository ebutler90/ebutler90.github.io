      <h2>Covering: Classes (When, Why, How?)</h2>
      <h4>Sunday, January 25, 2015</h4>
      <p>Classes are an intersting concept, and they are actually incredibly helpful. It's kind of hard to understand why classes are necessary when you're first starting to learn code, because most of the programs we are writing are pretty simple, and dont have to do to much; but classes will really come into play when there are expanses of code that do a ton of different things, and use a multitude of data. The simplest way to think of classes is to think of them as containers.</p>
      <p>I say that you should think of classes as containers, because all methods that you write within a class are contingent on the class that they are a part of. The class can be any problem that you're trying to solve. You then create methods within the class to "solve" your problem. Then you can create "instances" of your classes and run the methods on each of the instances that you create. It's a little bit easier to understand when you actually see it in practice, so here is an example of a class, it's methods, and creating an instance of the class: </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
              class GuessingGame
                def initialize(answer)
                  @answer = answer
                end

                def guess(guess)
                  @guess = guess
                  if @guess > @answer
                    p :high
                  elsif @guess < @answer
                    p :low
                  else @guess = @answer
                    p :correct
                  end
                end

                def solved?
                  if @guess == @answer
                    p true
                  else
                    p false
                  end
                end
              end

              #drivertests
              game = GuessingGame.new(89)
              game.solved?
              game.guess(7)
              game.guess(100)
              game.solved?
              game.guess(89)
              game.solved?
      </pre>
      <p> The example of above shows a class GuessingGame which is the "problem" that's trying to be solved. The methods guess and solved? are created to solve the problem of the guessing game. The driver test shows how those methods interact with the class. So you create an instance of the class using a new variable (game in this case). Then you can run the define methods on this instance of class to solve Guessing game.
