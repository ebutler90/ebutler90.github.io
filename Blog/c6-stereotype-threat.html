      <h2>Covering: Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <h4>Sunday, February 1, 2014</h4>
      <p>This blog assignment was really beneficial for me, because it gave me a vocabulary for the feelings that I've experienced (pretty often) within the math, science, and now the technology field. According to Steele & Aronson, 1995 "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group". As a woman of color, I truly feel as though I deal with stereotype threat every moment that I step out of my house, and these days, every time I open up a DBC assignment. On a macro scale, I have been conditioned to make sure to not be too loud in public, to dress a certain way in certain environments to try to avoid less than favorable treatment. I'm fearful of fulfilling the stereotype of "loud, trashy minority", which in reality shouldnt be something that I worry about, but is something that weighs on me every day. On a micro level, I experience the stereotype threat of failing in the technology field. I've been so nervous about not doing well, that I actually avoided/have been avoiding telling people in my life that I joined the program, for fear of being asked to leave and proving the stereotype of "women not belonging in technology" correct. I've actually never heard the phrase "stereotype threat" before, so it was intriguing (albeit very sad) to see that this phenomina affects minortiy students in universities everywhere. The fear of proving stereotypes correct is so stressful, that it's a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
      <p>I'm trying to make an effort to break this cycle. I've made sure to make connections with people in my cohort who come from similar backgrounds as me to let them know that they are not alone in this. I'm working my hardest to create a positive mental and emotional environment for myself, so that I can learn and create without the fear of failing because "i'm a woman". I want to be a pillar of positive energy for my fellow women (and men) of color, because vibes are contagious. I want us all to know that we can in fact succeed, no matter what the stereotypes may say.</p>
