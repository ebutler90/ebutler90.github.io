      <h2>Covering: Blocks, Procs & Lambdas </h2>
      <h4>Sunday, February 1, 2015</h4>
      <p>I chose to do this week's blog on a topic that I was relatively unfamilar with. At this point, we've had coding experience with blocks, but I had no idea what a proc or a lambda was. On a very base level, blocks, procs, and lambdas are all closures in Ruby. Closures are essentially containers for information that can be called and run.</p>
      <p>Blocks are the closures that are the most "commonly" used and essentially containters of code that are used as functions within methods. Blocks do not exist on their own; they are always attached by to a methods. They contain code that will be executed based on the directions that the method they are in provides. <br>
      There are situations that will occur when a simple block will not suffice. If you want to pass multiple blocks, or you want to save your block to a variable to be used elsewhere, then you can use procedures (aka procs). Procs are blocks that you can actually save to a variable and use elsewhere within your code. Unlike blocks, procs are objects. There is one next level of closures to be aware of, and they are lamdas. According to Erik Trautman: "If Procs are sort of a more-fleshed-out version of blocks, then lambdas are sort of a more-fleshed-out version of Procs. They are one step closer to being actual methods themselves." Lambdas are a stricter than procs however, because they will raise an error if they are not passed the correct number of arguments (procs dont care.)    </p>
