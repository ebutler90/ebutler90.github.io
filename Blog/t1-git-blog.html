      Question 1: What are the benefits of version control? <br>
      I don't want to go into this with the assumption that you even know what version control is. So as a (very) quick explanation: Version control is the concept of saving your work/progress in git. Now, this is beneficial for a few reasons. Version control allows for you (or anyone else who has access to your work) to basically go back in time to any point that you saved. This is great just in case you need to test some code, and it breaks, you can just go back to the point where it was working and start fresh. But it's even better for collaboration purposes. Team members, or new people on the project will have access to earlier versions of code, or will be able to create their own versions of code that can ultimately be merged with your own. Version control is essentially in place to say to any developer "Hey, it's okay to try things out and be crazy. We've got an older version saved. You're safe."

        Question 2: How does git help you keep track of changes? <br>
        So, this is very closely related to the first question about Version control. Git has very specific arguments that help you save multiple versions of your work. This act of saving your work (creating a version) is called a commit. <br>
        Any change you make to a file within your git repository is tracked. You can check on these changes using the argument "Git status". This will print out a list of all changes that have not been set to commit. Git will print out basic directions
