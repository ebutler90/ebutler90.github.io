      <h3>Covering: Version Control, Tracking Changes, Git & Github</h3>
      <h4>Monday, December 29th, 2014</h4>

      <p>Question 1: What are the benefits of version control? <br>
      I don't want to go into this with the assumption that you even know what version control is. So as a (very) quick explanation: Version control is the concept of saving your work/progress in git. Now, this is beneficial for a few reasons. Version control allows for you (or anyone else who has access to your work) to basically go back in time to any point that you saved. This is great just in case you need to test some code, and it breaks, you can just go back to the point where it was working and start fresh. But it's even better for collaboration purposes. Team members, or new people on the project will have access to earlier versions of code, or will be able to create their own versions of code that can ultimately be merged with your own. Version control is essentially in place to say to any developer "Hey, it's okay to try things out and be crazy. We've got an older version saved. You're safe."
    </p>
    <p>
        Question 2: How does git help you keep track of changes? <br>
        So, this is very closely related to the first question about Version control. Git has very specific arguments that help you save multiple versions of your work. This act of saving your work (creating a version) is called a commit. <br>
        Any change you make to a file within your git repository is tracked. You can check on these changes using the argument "Git status". This will print out a list of all changes that have not been set to commit. Git will print out basic directions and options for you. The next general step will be to add the changes and set them up for an official commit. Do this by typing "git add (insert file name here)". Once again, check your git status, and it will print that your changes are ready to be committed. Commit by using the command "commit -m "insert commit message here" of by "commit-v" which will lead you to your text editor. Add your commit message there, save, and close that window. You'll be able to see your commit in the terminal. Push these changes from git to github via the git argument "git push", and you'll be able to see all of your commits within your github repository.

    </p>
    <p>
        Question 3: Why use GitHub to store your code? <br>
        From what I've read, github is not the only version control system out there. But it's the one I've heard about the most. Git has a huge following, and from a bit of outside research, it seems as though this is because of the way that github tracks information. Instead of just tracking changes, Github essentially takes a snapshot of your work at the time of each commit, so it's a stream of snapshots to file through. The huge community behind github in turn offers a much larger group of developers that are available to look at your code. As a (very) new developer, I've also found github to be very intuitive and user friendly. I dont have experience with other version control systems, but the combination of developer praise and my already positive experience with Github so far, it seems like the best place to store your code at this point in time.
