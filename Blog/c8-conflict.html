      <h2>Covering: Conflict</h2>
      <h4>Sunday, February 15, 2015</h4>
      <p>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?<br>
        One conflict that really stands out for me, while I'm in this environment of learning, is an issue I had with a former classmate in college. He was an older guy, and had a job/wife/kids/etc. We each had a portion of a project to do, and it was supposed to be sent to me days in advance, so that I could compile, and then create a conclusion based on his findings. He just didnt do his part. An hour before the presentation, he showed up in the computer lab I was in and started to write the portion of the paper that he told me "he'd already completed". I completely flipped out; and still to this day remember how uncomfortable our argument was.
      </p>
      <p>What was the source of the conflict?<br>
        The source of the conflict really was that he truly just didn't care about the project, and was willing to let everyone else suffer because he refused to admit to his lack of work. I felt completely disrespected, more so about the lying than anything else, because I would have helped do the work if he was feeling overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?<br> The basic emotions that I felt upon analyzing the conflict were anger, disappointment, and fear. I was furious at the way that things played out. I couldnt believe he had the audacity to lie and then try to do weeks worth of work in about 40 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?<br>
        This was tough. I basically screamed a lot, which actually didn't resolve the conflict AT ALL (but it did make me feel better. Which is something I've since worked on.) Then there was a lot of scrambling to get his part completed. It was pretty much a disaster.
      </p>
      <p>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?<br>
        If I could go back, I probably should have been less polite about his not handing in work at the agreed upon time (days prior to the actual due date.) I was too much of a pushover in the beginning which led to me beiing upset and angry and crazy later.
      </p>
      <p>What did you learn from this experience?<br>
        I learned that if I was more assertive early on, I would have been able to handle the conflict when it was a smaller conflict and not a huge problem. I needed to learn to be better about being upfront with things, instead of letting them get out of hand and causing mysel emotional trauma later.
