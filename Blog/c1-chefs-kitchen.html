  <h2>Covering: Thoughts on DBC Experience</h2>

       Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?  What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br>
       Based on the video, I was able to draw a few conclusions on what the DBC expereince will be like. I believe that this expereince will first and foremost be what I make of it. Shereef's comments about understanding that this is all an "experiment" and that everyone should walk in with the creative, determined mindset really spoke to me. I truly feel that being a part of DBC is a privilege, and all participants should understand that and make the most of this experience. I'm a firm believer in creating the life that you want to live, and I am under the impression that DBC will allow you to do just that.   I am so used to being pushed cookie-cutter curriculums and learning situations, that I'm excited to be able to engage in this type of learning-culture. I am admittedly a bit nervous. I don't have a huge amount of experience with always working in pair-situations, so this will be a very new thing for me. I'm excited to engage with my cohort-mates though, and meld into this culture of sharing and mutual growth.

        Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? <br>
        My expectations of DBC have not really changed. I was introduced to the program through a friend, and had the pleasure of visiting the NY campus twice, so I was aware of the culture, and knew the kind of environment I was getting myself into.

      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? <br>
    </p>I'm very very excited to participate in DBC's learning environment. But I'm also so nervous. I want to be great at this, and I know that I have it in me to be amazing. But those pesky nerves are still fighting their way into my psyche. I think that things will be a bit better once I actually get to the in-person immersive stage.
