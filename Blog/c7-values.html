      <h2>Covering:Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <h4>February 8, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind: Accomplishment, Close relationships, Competence/Excellence, Economic Security, Freedom, Feeling Seen/Accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a scale from 1 to 5, I try to live up to these values at a 5 (at all times.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of feeling competence/excellence is very important to me. My mom came to this country when she was 8 years old, and she's been working hard ever since. She made my sister's and I her life, and did everything that she could for my sisters and I to live an easier life thatn she did. I feel deeply indebted to her, and it is my responsible to be excel at the things that I do, to make her proud. I want her to know that her sacrifices were not made in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last value that someone asked me for advice on was the "close relationships" topic. It is very important to me to make sure that the people in my life are happy. I work very hard to maintain deep, personal relationships with the people in my life. I think hat This leads to my friends asking advice on how to handle their various relationships (romantic or otherwise). I've given a ton of life advice recently. ( I think it has something to do with Valentine's Day rapidly approaching.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I do think that focusing on my values will help me mediate the stereotype threat that I experience. I never thought about it, but my desire to make my mother proud, and feel accomplished and excellent will help me to battle the feeling of "I'm not good enough." I imagine creating close relationships with others at DBC will be helpful to create a healthy supportive environment within the space.
