      <h2>Covering: Enumerable #Map</h2>
      <h4>January 20, 2015</h4>

      <p>The topic we will be covering today is the topic of the .map Enumerable (which is also known as .collect) This particular enumerable is a non-destructive method that will take information from an input array, make a copy of the array, and the loop through every element of the array and perform actions you specified in the block (the instructions for the .map enumerable). </p>

      <p> For example, you may want to take an array, and find out what each of the elements will look like capitalized, but you still want to keep the original array intact. You could use .map to output a capitalized array while keeping the original array intact.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
          cat_array = ["tabby", "tom", "puss-in-boots"]
          big_cat = cat_array.map{|x| x.capitalize}

          puts big_cat #=> ["Tabby", "Tom", "Puss-in-boots"]
          puts cat_array #=> ["Tabby", "Tom", "Puss-in-boots"]
        </pre>
      </p>

      <p>This is a really helpful method for iterating over an exiting array or hash if you need to keep your original array for whatever reason. It'll output your transformed array or hash as an entirely new object.
