      <h1>Issues in Technology</h1>
      <h2>Covering: The Lack of Diversity in the Technology Industry & Navagating The Field as a Woman of Color</h2>
      <h4>January 20, 2015</h4>
      <p>The talk about diversity in the technology industry isn't new. There has been a whole firestorm in the media because Google recently released their diversity reports, and the results were exactly what everyone expected: the majority of their employees were white males. To be more specific, only 17% of their employees are women. To be even more specific than that, only 2% of their employees are black. So needless to say, the "diversity" situation is pretty dismal. Google is not alone in this struggle though. Many other technology companies followed suit, and revealed that their numbers all looked similar to Google. There is a myriad of subtopics that can be covered under the umbrella of the lack of diversity in the tech field. I'm going to focus on what rings the more real to me. Why is it that there are so few black women/women of color in the techology industry.  There are two questions that need to be addressed then. Why are things this way? What can we do to change them?</p>

      <p>It's an interesting thing to do research on an issue that you live through, and to see how people pen articles on "your" life experience. I found a fantastic article on <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education"> Mother Jones </a>  that did a great job of covering a lot of what is wrong with the tech industry in this day and age. But there was one particular portion that really spoke to me.
        <blockquote>"Take Janet, the sole black girl in Canyon's AP computer science class, who told the researchers she signed up for the course in part "because we [African American females] were so limited in the world, you know, and just being able to be in a class where I can represent who I am and my culture was really important to me." When she had a hard time keeping up—like most kids in the class—the teacher, a former software developer who, researchers noted, tended to let a few white boys monopolize her attention, pulled Janet aside and suggested she drop the class, explaining that when it comes to computational skills, you either "have it or don't have it." "</blockquote>

        This is not an isolated incident, and there are a million different sociatal issues that manifest themselves in an incident like the one described above. Seeing as we live in a country where quality of education is based on tax dollars from that particular neighborhood, poor areas will, by default have a smaller number of resources and have a different quality of education that those of children in richer neighborhoods. It's also not a secret that a majority of those poor neighborhoods have a large minority population. So. Part 1 of the problem? Underfuned/lesser quality education puts many minoroity children at a disadvantage in the math and sciences.
        Part 2 is the issue of sex. The joke of "girls are bad at math" starts very young. That mentality of girls not being as good as boys is inherent, pervasive, and starts to truly take hold as early as middle school. (<a href ="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education">source</a>) There is the inherent bias towards helping male students, because males are never taught to be quiet and voice their concerns (whereas women are taught to make themselves small, and seen but not heard.)
        Those two parts (which are being explained very generally on my part) combine to a situation where are huge portion of black and minority girls began to fall away from the STEM careers. It's a vicious cycle of lack of representation reinforcing the ideas that women, and even more specifically women of color cannot do well in the technology sector. </p>
        <p> So what can be done? This is not and will not be an easy fix. It's a problem that goes deep into socioeconomics and race relations. However, thinking in a very high level way, there just needs to be improvement in the quality of technological education afforded to minority children in poorer neighborhoods. It also can't just be a computer class here or there. It needs to be a systematic overhaul of the way that children are learning technology. The logic needed to be a good programmer should be instilled early-on. There needs to be exposure to programming and it needs to be exposure that is inclusive of all learning types (visual, hands on, etc). Secondly, there needs to be a change in the way that young women are dealt with in the stem (specifically technology) fields. That must start early on, and requires a societal effort to shift the thinking of our peers and our youth. Girls need to grow up knowing that they are equal and have the same abilities. They must be encouraged and nurtured to explore their possibilites in tech fields.
