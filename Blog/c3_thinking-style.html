      <h1>U1.W3: Cultural Blog: Your Thinking Style and Learning </h1>
      <h2>Covering: My Gregoric Thinking Style & Adapting My Learning to My Thinking </h2>
      <h4>Sunday, January 11, 2014</h4>
      <p>My Gregoric thinking style is Abstract Random. I think the first time I heard that, I was in high school, and I thought nothing of it. But when I became a part of DBC and this learning style came up again, I realized it was something I really should pay attention to.</p>
      <p>Upon doing a bit more research, I was able to find out a bit more about how my mind works. According to cortland.edu, the abstract perceptual quality is when one visualizes and conceive ideas which you cannot actually see. It also means that one is relying heavily on their intuition and imagination. The random ordering ability means that the individual's mind organizes information in orderless chunks.  There is a tendancy to skip around within a process and start anywhere (beginning, middle, or end.) </p>
      <p>As I am with most things, I was very skeptical of this whole learning style test. But the more that I read, the more I understood that these things really spoke true to how I often thought and worked through problems. It was time to figure out how to use this to my advantage while studying at DBC. I found some resources that explained AR learners work best when:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt> they can work and share with others</dt>
          <dd>So, I need to learn to get over my shyness and fear of seeming unknowledable, and start pairing more often</dd>
        <dt>they get personal attention and emotional support</dt>
        <dd>This was something that I've actually known about myself for a while. I try to foster mututally satisfying emotionally supportive relationships with my peers in order to maintain my sanity. My accountability group has been great for that so far.</dd>
        <dt>has open communication with others</dt>
        <dd>Again, my fear of seeming ignorant is something I need to kick to the curb, so that I can openly communicate my concern, confusions, etc at DBC. I know that there will be a ton of communication in the DBC environment and I will flourish if I take advantage of that opportunity. </dd>
        <dt>has a non-competitive atmosphere </dt>
        <dd>I know that DBC is not a competition, and we are all there to learn; but I do have a fear of being the "worst one". I will just have to make sure to remind myself that this is not a race or competition, but instead a nurturuing learning environment. </dd>
        </dl>
        <p> It was great to be able to do all of this research and learn a bit more about how my mind works. This ties directly into the concept of growth vs fixed mindest. I know that intelliegence is not static, and now that I know where my learning and thinking strengths lay I feel prepared to force myself to grow. I will push to communicate more, so that I can really get the most out of my learning experience. I will make sure to ease the feeling competition, and be more active in the group aspect of the learning experience. </p>
