      <h1>U3.W8.Technical Blog</h1>
      <h2>Covering: What is Ruby on Rails?</h2>
      <h4>Sunday, February 15th, 2015</h4>
      <p>I chose this topic because I came into DBC pretty much cold. I just dont know much about the tech industry, so every day, I'm learning something completely new. I knew that Ruby on Rails (or simply....Rails) was something that everyone talks about; but I knew absolutely nothing about it. When this sort of "free for all / blog on whatever technology you want" topic came up, I knew that this would be a great opportunity to get my feet wet on this Rails topic before making it into the DBC space.</p>
      <p> So, let's get to it. Rails is a "fullstack open source web application framework." That is a lot of technical words, so let's break that down a bit. Fullstack essentially means that all applications of Rails are included within the platform; there is no additional software (outside of Rails) needed to create anything in Rails. Open source means that it can be updated and added to by any developer (the source code is readily available to be used however one wants.) Web application framework is software that helps build dynamic websites. Rails applications run on a web-server, which makes Rails "back-end"</p>
      <p>Rails itself is essential a library of software that adds onto the Ruby programming language (it is a RubyGem). The code that comprises Rails operates under specific conventions. The two main conventions are "Don't Repeast Yourself (D.R.Y.)" and "Convention over configuration".  These conventions help to create an environment of code that is efficient and uniform. The convention over configuration mindset allows for there to be specific conventions that all applications follow, and makes it so that the developer only has to write code that doesn't specifically adhere to the conventions (or isn't already specified in the conventions.) Due to these conventions, Rails essentially has specific ways to solve many common web appication problems. When you install Rails on your comp, it comes with generators that help make developing in Rails an easy task. For example, there is the new application generator, which provides you with a built in foundation of a Rails app so you donâ€™t have to figure out building it up on  your own. A directory will be created, that will contain auto-generated files that make up the structure of a Rails application. These directories allow for creating solutions to a problem, with most of the pre-work being done and available to you in these pre-created directories.</p>
      <p> There is absolutely a magnitude of information out there about Rails, that I have not been able to wrap my head around yet. But, it's been interesting to gain a basic understanding of what Rails is, and how I will be interacting with it soon! </p>
