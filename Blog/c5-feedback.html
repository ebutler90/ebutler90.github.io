      <h2>Covering: Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>
      <h4>Sunday, January 25, 2015</h4>
      <h3>Pairing</h3>
      <p> It's been really intersting to pair. At first, the idea of showing the gaps in my knowledge to a stranger was really terrifying to me. But, I've gotten much more comfortable with the idea of not knowing everything. I've found that pairing with other has been really helpful to me, because it allows me a space to talk out all of my ideas and get immediate feedback on them. It's been so intersting to see how differntly other people think as well! As I've gotten the hang of concepts, I've been able to have back and forth converstations on what would be the best way to solve certain problems, and I like seeing the way that other people's brains work. </p>
      <p>I had one of the most rewarding pairing sessions so far this week. It was really wonderful to find a person who was patient with the things I did not know, and forced me to answer questions about concepts before we moved forward. I've also just found that all of the people that I've paired with so far have been truly wonderful people. Of course there have been energies that worked better with mine than others, but I have not encountered a single unkind, soul and it's made me very excited to be in the DBC space.</p>
      <p>I think the only frustrating thing I've really experienced is the feeling of being "behind". It's a nerve-wracking thing pair with someone who has a better grasp of the information, and sometimes I get frustrated that I dont understand something. But other than that, my pairing sessions have been overwhelming positive. </p>
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>My feedback so far has been incredibly kind. It has been nice to know that people enjoy working with me. As previousy mentioned, I'd been nervous about holding people back/not being good at a particular program. But everyone has been understanding and given very pointed feedback about what I can do to improve. </p>
      <p>There were two pieces of feedback that I found incredibly helpful. Both feedback encouraged me to not be discouraged by things I didn't understand, but to instead branch out and find other resources to use. I've tried Codeacademy, but it's not my favorite way to learn. What I have found though is that reading the well grounded rubyist has been greattttt for my comprehension. I've always been a reader, so sitting down and reading my way through the chapters has been really helpful. Even if the information doesnt make perfect sense, I've gotten to the point where things I've read have come back to help me in challenges/pairing sessions. </p>
      <p> I find writing feedback to be a little difficult, because I often only see the good in a person's session. I've had a hard time thinking of constructive feedback for someone, unless it was glaringly negative. </p>
