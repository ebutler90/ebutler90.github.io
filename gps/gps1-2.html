It is a situation in which two programmers work together on the same problem or challenge. It is common practice for the two programmers to be working side-by-side at the same machine, but it is also possible to do remotely via video chatting and screen-share services.
            When pair-programming, one of the individuals  will do the actual typing of the code. This person is the Driver. The second person, is the one who will dictate what to type and review each line of code; this person is the Navigator. These roles can stay stagnant throughout the pairing session, or can be alternated to equalize the workload. </p><img src="imgs/pair_programming.jpg" alt="Pair programming team Ian and Greg create software together while sharing workstation." title="pair programming picture"> </article>
            <article><a name="topic2"></a><h2>Why Pair Programming is Important to DBC</h2><p>Teamwork and group work are both essential to Dev Bootcamp.  Pair programming provides an opportunity for students to share knowledge and learn from each other.  It allows each person within the pair to have access to other viewpoints, thus allowing them to see other possible ways of solving problems.  DBC works to create a healthy learning environment and pair programming has been proven to create satisfaction among programmers and give them more confidence in their code.</p></article>
            <article><a name="topic3"></a><h2>Driver and Navigator Roles</h2><p>As stated previously, pair programming involves dividing work into two roles: driver and navigator.  The driver’s responsibilities include typing code in the code editor,  following the navigator’s instructions, and driving the coding process forward.  The navigator’s responsibilities include reviewing each line of code as it’s typed for syntax errors or other problems, as well as steering the coding process more generally with an overall view towards the bigger strategic picture.</p></article>
